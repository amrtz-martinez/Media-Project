# Hand-Gestural-MediaPlayer
Music media player controlled by hand gesture

The MediaPlayer is controlled through hand gestures.

1-Finger: Play the first song added\
2-Fingers: Play the next song\
3-Fingers: Play the prevous song\
5-Fingers: Stop the song

Used Tkinter and Pygame, but we faced an issue where both of these functions did not work together.\
Unfortunately, we could not find a fix to this solution.\
Seperately, the MediaPlayer and hand tracker work.
